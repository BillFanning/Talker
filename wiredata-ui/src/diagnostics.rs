//! Shared presentation primitives for compact, decision-oriented diagnostics.
//!
//! The applications decide what each signal means and when it deserves attention;
//! this module owns only the identical egui chrome: a quiet card, status badge,
//! aligned signal rows, and a restrained attention callout.
//!
//! # Shared readout vocabulary
//!
//! A technician may read both applications' panels in one session, so a
//! measurement in the same *state* should be described the same way in both. The
//! domain noun differs — Talker counts scheduled sends, Listener counts read
//! chunks and rule firings — but the states, and how each one is worded, do not.
//! The columns are real renderings, so a change on one side that this table
//! cannot describe is a divergence, not a variation:
//!
//! | State | When | Talker | Listener |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | Awaiting first sample | nothing measured yet this run | `awaiting the first scheduled send` | `awaiting the first chunk` |
//! | Measured | the recent window has samples | `worst was 4 ms behind schedule · 812 scheduled sends reached` | `Handoff worst 4 ms · 812 chunks in ~last 10 s` |
//! | No recent samples | the run has samples, the recent window does not | `nothing sent in ~last 10 s · worst this run 9 ms` | `no chunks in ~last 10 s · Handoff worst 9 ms this run` |
//! | Expired | Talker only — see below | `recent snapshot expired · as of 11.0 s ago` | — |
//! | Final | Talker only — the exact-at-stop snapshot | `final snapshot` | — |
//!
//! Conventions that go with it:
//!
//! - **`≤`, not `<=`.** Bucketed histograms yield an upper bound, never an exact
//!   percentile, and the glyph is what says so.
//! - **Two windows, named.** A rolling window (`~last 10 s` while running,
//!   `~final 10 s` once stopped) sits beside a cumulative `run max`. Any readout
//!   showing both must label which is which.
//! - **No sample-count gate.** State the largest value with its sample count —
//!   exact, and true at one sample — and add the percentile only when
//!   `p99 < max`. There is no warming-up state in either application. (Why the
//!   twenty-sample gate was retired: talker ADR-046, listener ADR-037.)
//! - **Name the largest value for what it is.** A late send and a slow handoff
//!   are the *worst* ones, but the longest gap between two reads is just the
//!   longest — a quiet source is not a fault, and the superlative should not
//!   imply one.
//! - **No invented health thresholds.** Neither application scores latency
//!   against a budget it does not have; escalation comes from evidence that
//!   something is actually wrong (a confirmed drop, a queue at half capacity),
//!   not from a timing number being large.
//!
//! # How certain a reading is
//!
//! Both applications report things they measured directly, things they can only
//! point at, and things they cannot see at all. That difference is carried by
//! [`Evidence`] — three words, defined here once — rather than by a paragraph of
//! qualifiers under each result. A caveat repeated everywhere stops being read;
//! a label that is always one of three things gets learned.
//!
//! Reach for prose only where a *specific* boundary is not implied by the label
//! — that a counter excludes loss upstream of this socket, say. "This is
//! indirect" is the label's job.
//!
//! The rule lives in both applications rather than here: it reads a
//! `wiredata-telemetry` histogram, and this crate depends on `egui` alone. See
//! `timing_figures` in `talker/src/gui/diagnostics.rs` and in
//! `listener/src/gui/detail/diagnostics.rs` — they are deliberately the same
//! function, and a change to one is a change to the vocabulary above.
//!
//! *Expired* and *Final* are Talker-only, and deliberately so: Talker pushes
//! collapsed snapshots that age between emissions, while Listener collapses each
//! window when a request is served and so cannot serve a stale one. That
//! asymmetry follows from the two runtime models and is recorded in talker
//! ADR-043 and listener ADR-035 — it is not a gap to be filled on either side.
