//! OS timer-resolution management for automatic high-rate and explicit
//! precision schedules (ADR-017, ADR-034).
//!
//! The runner's deadline waits (`recv_deadline`, ADR-002) wake on the OS
//! scheduler tick — **15.625 ms** by default on Windows. That is finer than
//! any sensible sleep for a 10 Hz schedule, but *coarser than the interval*
//! of a 100 Hz one: every wake arrives more than one interval late, the
//! stall policy skips the backlog (spec §8.1), and ~40% of the grid never
//! fires. Requesting 1 ms resolution (`timeBeginPeriod(1)`) while a
//! sub-[`HIGH_RATE_THRESHOLD`] schedule is running fixes the miss rate.
//!
//! A schedule at or above that threshold instead stages a coarse wait, requests
//! high resolution for the final [`PRECISION_WINDOW`] before a slower send,
//! then releases it after the deadline wake. This tightens deadline wakes without
//! holding the Windows power policy continuously. [`CadenceAlignment`] is the
//! separate choice that can phase deadlines to UTC; neither setting makes the wall
//! clock itself more accurate or proves when bytes reach the wire.
//!
//! - **No elevation needed**; the request is per-process since Windows 10
//!   2004, so other processes never see it.
//! - **Leak-proof across death**: the kernel releases a process's resolution
//!   request on termination (including a kill), so the RAII guard here is
//!   about releasing *early* when the last fast channel stops, not about
//!   correctness after a crash.
//! - **Windows 11 throttling**: by default the OS ignores the request while
//!   the process window is minimized/occluded — exactly when a long soak
//!   runs. [`keep_timer_resolution_when_minimized`] opts out once at startup.
//!
//! The shared resolution guard is an effective no-op off Windows because native
//! deadline waits are not governed by the Windows timer period. A future macOS App
//! Nap activity policy is separate from timer resolution; see talker TODO.md.
