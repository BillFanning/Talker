//! Warnings the reader has acknowledged, and what brings them back.
//!
//! A warning that cannot be dismissed teaches the reader to look past it; one
//! that never returns is a warning deleted rather than acknowledged. Both
//! notices here stand on a counter that only grows within a run, which gives an
//! honest middle: record the count at the moment of dismissal, and speak again
//! when it is exceeded. The reader is told once per occurrence, and a fault that
//! is still spreading is never silent.
//!
//! This is presentation state only. Nothing here changes what is counted, and
//! the counted totals stay on screen either way — dismissing the missed-send
//! routing hides the advice, not the misses, which remain on the send-outcomes
//! line and keep the card's badge raised.
