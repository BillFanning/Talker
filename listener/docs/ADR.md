# Architecture Decision Record — Listener

**Crate:** listener
**Status:** Draft (tracks the listener spec)

---

This file is the home for `Listener`'s architecture decisions. Some decisions are
authored inline in the spec where the surrounding context lives — those are listed
here with a pointer to the authoritative section in
[`listener_specification.md`](listener_specification.md) rather than duplicated. Workspace-
and `talker`-level decisions live in [`talker/docs/ADR.md`](../../talker/docs/ADR.md);
`nmea0183` decisions in [`nmea0183/docs/ADR.md`](../../nmea0183/docs/ADR.md). Listener
keeps its own ADR numbering (it is a separate crate), so Listener's ADR-001 is *not*
the same as talker's ADR-001.

## ADR-001 — Concurrency model: Tokio hybrid

**Authoritative text:** spec §97.1 (with §97.2 blocking-to-async handoff, §99 backpressure, §111 shutdown). Summarized here so the decision is discoverable from the ADR index.

**Decision:** A hybrid runtime. Tokio owns orchestration — command handling, cancellation, bounded queues, fan-out, async-native network I/O, shutdown. Continuous blocking serial receive loops run on dedicated OS threads that own the interface handle and hand data to the async side through bounded `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels (`Sender::blocking_send`). `spawn_blocking` is reserved for bounded, finite operations (open/close, file create/flush, port enumeration) — never for continuous receive loops. Transports are push-based: data-bearing transports emit `ReceivedData`, TCP listeners emit `NewConnection`.

**Contrast with `talker`:** talker deliberately uses **no** async runtime (talker ADR-002 — `std::thread` + `crossbeam-channel`), because it manages a bounded set of *outbound* senders against synchronous `serialport`/`eframe` APIs. Listener faces the opposite shape: many *inbound* network sources, async-native socket I/O, and dynamic TCP-connection fan-in — where Tokio's orchestration earns its keep. The two crates therefore reach opposite conclusions for the same reason (fit the runtime to the I/O shape), and that divergence is intentional.

**Consequences:**
- `blocking_send` backpressure can stall a serial reader → UART/driver overrun, reported as transport-specific loss (§99, §101).
- Continuous blocking loops need a bounded read timeout so they can observe cancellation; shutdown never relies on interrupting an in-progress blocking read (§111).
- Message timing is chunk-granular (`ChunkTime`, §138), not true per-byte hardware timing; per-message timing is derived in the extractor.

## ADR-002 — Messages are immutable; decoders are read-only

**Authoritative context:** spec Part on Messages/Decoders (§131–§135, §140).

**Decision:** A `Message` is immutable once emitted by the extractor. Decoders never mutate Messages — they only produce read-only annotations (protocol metadata, integrity metadata). Display formatting never affects what is recorded (Raw Recording is independent of rendering).

**Consequences:**
- Multiple downstream consumers (display, recording, decoding) can share Messages without coordination or copying.
- Raw recording fidelity is guaranteed regardless of decoder or display behavior.

## ADR-003 — Profile schema: single monotonic `schema_version`

**Authoritative text:** spec §72.1.

**Decision:** Profiles carry a single monotonically increasing `schema_version: u32`. Each binary knows one current version. Older additive changes load via field defaults; a profile newer than the binary is refused. This mirrors `talker`'s clean-break versioning (talker ADR-013) deliberately, so the two tools share one mental model.

---

## ADR-004 — Single crate, modular internals (resolves OQ-L1)

**Authoritative text:** spec §127–§128 (revised in listener spec v1.1.1).

**Context:** Spec §127 originally sketched a twelve-crate split (`listener-core`, `listener-runtime`, `listener-transport`, `listener-extract`, `listener-decode`, `listener-display`, `listener-record`, `listener-retention`, `listener-config`, `listener-diagnostics`, `listener-cli`, `listener-gui`) and nested `nmea0183` inside `listener`. The crate actually exists as a single `listener` crate alongside `talker` and `nmea0183`.

**Decision:** Keep **one `listener` crate**. The twelve `listener-*` units are realized as modules under `src/` (`core/`, `transport/`, `extract/`, …), preserving the §128 boundaries and dependency direction; only the packaging is collapsed. `nmea0183` is a top-level workspace sibling (shared with `talker`), referenced as an ordinary dependency — not nested. The `lib.rs` + thin-`main.rs` shape follows talker ADR-014, keeping module APIs unit-testable.

**Consequences:**
- §127 is the literal `src/` module map; §128 boundaries are normative whether a unit is a module (now) or a crate (later).
- A later split is non-disruptive: extract a module into a `listener-*` member crate when an external consumer or compile-time concern justifies it. That future split, if taken, gets its own ADR.

## Open questions

_None open. (OQ-L1 resolved by ADR-004 above.)_
