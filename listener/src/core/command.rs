//! Runtime event vocabulary the runtime orchestrator reports to the presentation
//! layers (spec §137).
//!
//! Events flow runtime → UI; the UI observes them and never owns transport,
//! recording, or pipeline state (§3). The *command* direction (UI → runtime) is
//! the [`Listener`](crate::runtime::Listener)'s async method API directly — there is
//! no separate runtime-command enum (ADR-012). The GUI's own `UiCommand`
//! (`gui::bridge`) is the on-the-wire form the driver translates into those calls.
